## Projects

### Project 1: Advanced TCP Chat Server
This project showcases a multi-client chat application using TCP sockets. The server can handle multiple clients simultaneously and relay messages between them, ensuring smooth communication.

### Project 2: Sockets Port Scanner
This project involves creating a simple port scanner that can scan a range of ports on a given host to check their status (open or closed). It's an excellent demonstration of using sockets for network security tasks.

### Project 3: TCP Time Server
This project involves building a TCP server that provides the current time to any client that connects. It's a great example of using TCP sockets to create a simple yet functional server-client application.

### Project 4: UDP Chat Server
This project features a chat server using UDP sockets. Unlike the TCP chat server, this one uses the User Datagram Protocol, demonstrating the differences and challenges of using a connectionless protocol.

### Project 5: UDP Time Server
Similar to the TCP time server, this project involves creating a time server using UDP sockets. It highlights the use of UDP for server-client communication where low overhead is required.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YousifGad/Python-Networking-Projects.git
```
## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Installation

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies. Each project may have its own set of dependencies, specified in a `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
